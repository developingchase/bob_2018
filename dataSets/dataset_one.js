   new tupleQuestion("Probably, he figured.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("After all, they were identical twins, and that meant they often thought—and felt—the same way about things.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("It was scary to think that maybe that would soon be ending too, now that they weren’t going to be together all the time.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Tiki wondered whether he should wave, or say hello.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("He decided not to risk it—Kevin might not even remember him after all this time.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("He might think Tiki was weird for saying hi, considering they barely knew each other.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("The rest of the way up the stairs, Tiki concentrated on the floor.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("So many feet!","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("All those different kinds of shoes .","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("He bumped into the girl in front of him when she stopped at the door to the second floor.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Sorry,” he said, glancing up at her.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("She clicked her tongue, rolled her eyes, and said, “Watch where you’re going, stupid.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Tiki felt like a complete idiot!","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Why did he have to bump into that girl?","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Was everybody in this school going to be as mean as her?","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("He felt like running right back down the stairs and outside, back into the beautiful September morning.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("But he knew he couldn’t.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("He found room 208, and headed straight for the back of the classroom, where he zoned in on the last available empty seat.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Tiki was determined to sit in the back of the class, where he could hide from the teacher’s gaze whenever he didn’t know the answer to a question.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Tiki turned around and checked out the rest of the seats.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("He quickly grabbed one in the third row—as far from the teacher’s desk as he could get.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Tiki promised himself that when this class was over, he’d run like the wind to get to his next classroom, so he’d have plenty of time to find a seat in the back row.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("His math teacher, Mr.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Watch it!","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Walker, who didn’t give them any homework because it was the first day of school.","CHAPTER TWO SCHOOL DAZE","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Yeah, but what if we aren’t?","CHAPTER FIVE MOM RULES","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Ronde knew what Tiki was trying to say—life at school would be great if they were starters on the team.","CHAPTER FIVE MOM RULES","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("But second-stringers didn’t play all that much.","CHAPTER FIVE MOM RULES","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Hey, check this out—Paco’s a starter!","CHAPTER SIX ALL SHOOK UP","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Huh?","CHAPTER SIX ALL SHOOK UP","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Tiki looked to where his twin was pointing.","CHAPTER SIX ALL SHOOK UP","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("Suddenly, the momentum seemed to have shifted.","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Cody Hansen, looking much more confident, completed three straight passes to three different receivers—the last one a perfectly thrown bomb down the sideline all the way to the Mountaineers’ twenty yard line.","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Then, on first down, Cody dropped back to pass.","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("But he must have seen an opening, because suddenly, he dashed through the middle on a quarterback draw, catching the Mountaineers off guard.","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("Cody made a quick move to his left, dodged the middle linebacker, and dove into the end zone for a touchdown!","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("First, their running back had the ball stripped from his hands by Eagles’ linebacker Ira Gutzel.","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),

   new tupleQuestion("But that would mean giving up on their lifelong dream!","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("How could they do that?","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
   new tupleQuestion("They rode until they reached the top of the mountain.","CHAPTER SEVEN RIDING THE BENCH","Barber, Tiki","Kickoff!"),
