   new tupleQuestion("Then I walked out of the wrinkly hilly part and out of the trees and into the bright dusty sun, around all those rows of grapevines, following the fence down near the street.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("There are rows and rows and rows of grapevines on both sides of our driveway, and lots of plants in between them that Dad says are weeds and aren’t supposed to be there.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I like the patterns that all the rows make when you walk by them.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("It doesn’t smell like grapes out there, just like dust.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("But, if you look hard, sometimes you see little tiny green balls that Dad says will turn into real grapes eventually.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I walked for a long time, more than an hour, and ended up all the way back behind the barn again.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Then I kind of felt more like I knew where I was.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I picked some flowers and put them in a jar for my desk and some in another jar for Mom’s desk too.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("At first I worried that they might belong to somebody, but then I remembered that the farm is ours, so these flowers must belong to us too.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),

   new tupleQuestion("I could hear the water and I kept wondering what that sound was, and then suddenly I saw it, running down the hill and over some rocks.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I never thought I would have a yard with a creek and big trees and blackberry bushes.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Our apartment building in LA had a few pots with some flowers and a big old lemon tree, but that was it.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Here, there’s so much dirt that you could probably plant fifty bean seeds and no one would even notice.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I don’t know what most of the trees and plants are, but there are a lot of them.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I should get a book about them from the library.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("But that whole time, I only saw one other house, way across the vineyard.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Mom still makes me wear my whistle all the time, but how am I going to get mugged or kidnapped if there aren’t even any people around?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("The only person I saw all day, aside from Gregory the mailman (I do like Gregory), was my dad.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Dad was trimming a grapevine.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("He had his gloves and Great-Uncle Jim’s special pruners.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("You can see these are totally overgrown,” he told me, showing me how our grapevines had long green stems springing out everywhere and getting in the way, but the ones over the fence on our neighbors’ vineyard kept their vines to themselves.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Then he started pruning one.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Uncle Jim should have pruned them back when spring started, but he probably wasn’t up to it by then.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("The grapevine he trimmed was looking pretty good until I noticed clear sticky stuff oozing out all over from everywhere he cut.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Dad, is it supposed to do this?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I asked.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("He took a look.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I’m not really sure,” he said quietly.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("So we both went and peered over the fence at the neighbors’ grapevines.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I didn’t see any sticky stuff on theirs.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Should we ask Mom about it?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I asked.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("He thought about it.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Better not interrupt her right now,” he said, and sighed.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("So Dad decided to take a break and walk back up to the house with me.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("On the way, he showed me a plant called poison oak that makes you itch all over if you touch it, and told me to keep an eye out for snakes.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("He says they like to lie in the warm sun, and sometimes they fall asleep and get surprised when you accidentally wake them up.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("But most of them aren’t poisonous, except for the rattlers.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("When he went off to work on his résumé, I decided to stay out of the plants and the sunny places for the rest of today while I get used to things around here.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("So I went to have a look in the building that’s kind of like a garage.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Inside, I saw the tractor and something else with wheels that none of us are sure what it is, not even Mom, and more of Great-Uncle Jim’s junk that’s metal.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Dad says it’s where Great-Uncle Jim used to weld things together to make new equipment and invent things for his farm.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I thought he meant like robots and things, but Dad says no.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Nothing in there looked like anything to do with animals, except maybe some more pieces of fence.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I decided that since Mom and Dad are busy, I should start trying to clean some things up around here.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Don’t worry, I got out my work gloves and my safety goggles, like the first day Dad took me out to do some work with him, before he figured out he didn’t know how to work any of the machinery and we didn’t have money for fence posts or trellis wire.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Mom says she’ll teach him how to drive the tractor when she has time, but who knows when she’ll have time?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("She has a lot of articles on her list, and that’s what pays the bills right now.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Great-Uncle Jim left huge piles of junk all over the yard, among the big trees and behind the buildings.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I thought at first I’d sort them out by type, because I like things to be orderly.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("But after dragging about twenty tires through the dirt, I gave up on that.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("How did Great-Uncle Jim get that many tires, anyway?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Maybe he had friends that snuck their junk in his piles too?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I bet he never even noticed.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("But why was he saving half a refrigerator door and five rusty stop signs?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I don’t think you’re supposed to take those home, even if they’re lying on the sidewalk.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("So I took a big long stick and started poking the piles, watching out for the loose lengths of rusty barbed wire that sprang out at me sometimes when stuff shifted, and looked to see what was there.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("But the thing I wanted to tell you about wasn’t in a pile at all.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("It was behind a pile.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I walked around toward a big blackberry bush and found some dirty sawhorses next to a bunch of stumps.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("It looked like there had been a fire or something.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Next to them, lying on its side in the tall weeds, there was a little house, with a front door that opened and closed.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("It looked like it was for those very small dogs that ride around in purses.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("Do you ever wonder if those purses are full of poop?","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
   new tupleQuestion("I do.","pg013","Jones, Kelly","Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer"),
